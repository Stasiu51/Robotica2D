# Robotica2D

A game I'm working on in unity that allows you to create composite self-replicating robots from hexagonal parts.

Written with a custom recursive state system.

The algorithm for computing the moves is a complex one involving multiple DFS steps to find an optimal solution to an arbitrary set of optional and mandatory constraints. Serialisaton is fully implemented.
